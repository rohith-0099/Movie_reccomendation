# Movie_reccomendation
🎬 Movie Recommendation System
This is a simple Python project that recommends movies using two methods:

Collaborative Filtering – recommends movies based on what similar users have liked.

Content-Based Filtering – recommends movies based on their genre.

⚙️ How it Works
The program loads two datasets:

One with movie details (like title and genre)

One with user ratings for those movies

It creates a user-movie rating matrix for collaborative filtering.

For content-based filtering, it uses movie genres and calculates similarity.

✨ Features
You can choose between:

Collaborative Filtering 🤝

Content-Based Filtering 📄

You just enter a movie title, and it gives 5 similar movie suggestions. 🎬
