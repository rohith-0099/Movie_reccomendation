# Movie_reccomendation

## 🎥 Movie Recommendation System



This is a simple Python project that recommends movies using two methods:

1. **Collaborative Filtering** – recommends movies based on what similar users have liked.

2. **Content-Based Filtering** – recommends movies based on their genre.



## ⚙️How it Works



- The program loads two datasets:

  - One with movie details (like title and genre)

  - One with user ratings for those movies

- It creates a user-movie rating matrix for collaborative filtering.

- For content-based filtering, it uses movie genres and calculates similarity.



## 🔮 Features



- You can choose between:

  - Collaborative Filtering

  - Content-Based Filtering

- You just enter a movie title, and it gives 5 similar movie suggestions.
